# Intro

I'm Mikhil, a passionate software engineer driven to create impactful solutions that address real-world business challenges.  While I enjoy tackling complex technical problems, my true passion lies in using technology to solve practical problems that deliver tangible value.

My journey began in 2011 when I embarked on a personal web application project. This sparked my interest in web development and the power of code to bring ideas to life.  Since launching my software development career in September 2018, I've continuously honed my skills and gained valuable experience.  Currently, I have the privilege of working at Worldpay by FIS India, a leading FinTech company.

My expertise lies in building scalable backend services and databases.  However, I possess a well-rounded skillset that encompasses both front-end and back-end technologies..
