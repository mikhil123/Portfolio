Hello! My name is Mikhil and I love building things. While hard engineering problem are fun to tackle,I am most attracted to solving live problems with business justification. My intrest started back in 2011 when I decided to try small web application project which taught me a lot about HTML & CSS. 
I started my career as software developer in september 2018 and have been working since. Currently I have privilege of working in FinTech domain company called Mosambee. While I'm proficient in front and back end technology, my expertise is building scalable backend services	and database.
